Start the unlocker after you opened the game, it will do it's thing, and then you should see another window pop out, that will confirm the unlocker has done its's job, press the keybind allocated to make the console show up.

# IF CONSOLE DOESNT SHOW UP, CHANGE KEYBINDS IN THE UNLOCKER.

type this command :

# viewmode unlit

Alternative to this command if it still locked

# nextviewmode

You can scroll between viewmodes with this command , pick the best one out of it.

To remove fullbright, just type

# viewmode lit

This will restore the game view as normal, even if is locked and you used nextviewmode command.
